# contract-billing-api

Hey There!

I am Akshar A. Patel. This is my Contract & Billing Project for my Flashtract Interview Process.

The project is self-sustaining meaning that all you have to do to test it, is clone it and run it on your local machine.

Within the project I have provided a PostMan Json file, which you can use to test the various endpoints of the project. Just import this JSON file into PostMan and you should be good to go.
